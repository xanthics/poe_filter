# poe_filter

This is a simple script to generate a filter file for Path of Exile using the included config files.

Usage
=====
Run Create_filter with necessary config files to generate xan.filter

Config
======
See template.py

To-Do
=====
No ETA
Add leveling gear
Add crafting bases
Add "best of the zone" highlighting.
Expand uniques filtering
Add rare highlighting based on drop level/item level
Add config processor that created compact output
No ETA: I work on this when I'm bored of releveling toons or farming.

Thanks

This script is heavily inspired by the discontinued "One Filter to rule them all"
