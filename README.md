# poe_filter

This is a simple script to generate a filter file for Path of Exile using the included config files.

[Hide Download](xan.hide.filter?raw=true)

[Show Download](xan.show.filter?raw=true)

Usage
=====
Run Create_filter with necessary config files to generate xan.filter.  Note that this will automatically put xan.show.filter and xan.hide.filter in <relative path>\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile

(Optional) Run Exiletool to update divination and unique tiers.  You will need to create "api_key.py" first with user and password.  See [Exile Tool API](http://api.exiletools.com/info/) for an API key(password).

To-Do
=====
No ETA

Add config processor that created compact output

Filtration compatibility

No ETA: I work on this when I'm bored of releveling toons or farming.

Thanks

This script is heavily inspired by "One Filter to rule them all" that can be found at https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1259059
