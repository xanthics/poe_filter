Scarabs are classified the same as fragments

Fossils and Resonators are treated the same as Essences but also have a show tier

Uniques have 2 special highlight rules.  Unique Show (white star, purple border) means that at least 1 drop of that basetype is worth 5+ chaos.  Unique Boss has the same triangle as Unique Low, but a green border to indicate that the 5c+ drop is boss only.
