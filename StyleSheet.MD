Scarabs are classified the same as fragments

Fossils and Resonators are treated the same as Essences but also have a show tier

Uniques have 2 special highlight rules.  Unique Special (white star, chaos border) means that at least 1 drop of that basetype is worth 5+ chaos.  Unique Limited is Cyan with a blue border to indicate that the 5c+ drop is limited only and has special conditions for dropping such as specific bosses or league mods.

Show Low Level is for 4x1, 3x1, and 2x2 vendor for chrome items < 67.  Also shows currency that is hidden in areas of 68+.
